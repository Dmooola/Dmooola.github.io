            <h2>The Rise of AI Intelligence in Media - 03/22/23</h2>
            <p>
                Across social media, AI is changing the way we interact. There has been a bevy of social media posts showing AI-generated children, posts, celebrity deepfakes, and much more. To the untrained eye, It can be difficult to assess what is real and what is not. The elderly and young children are especially susceptible because they both haven't spent enough time looking at real media as a reference for what is real and what is fake. I feel this will make people more susceptible to AI scams in the near future, as AI improves.

            <h2>AI LinkedIn Headshots? - 04/08/23</h2>
            <p>
                Are AI LinkedIn headshots unprofessional? As AI continues to be integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes harder and harder to decide what is acceptable and what is not. I've seen social media posts trending where people use AI to generate professional headshots using a photo the user uploaded. Technically, there's nothing wrong or illegal about these photos. But as employers find out about this trend, might it be considered unprofessional to use them? This raises an interesting question because many professional headshots are edited to look cleaner. However, this AI trend goes past editing and replaces entire outfits. I wonder how this might affect LinkedIn culture.

            <h2>Nigerian Yoruba Culture is Trending - 05/15/23(Updated 05/30/23)</h2>
            <p>
                Any Africans in tech and in tune with social media will notice that there has been a spike in interest in African culture. Growing up as a child from the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria in West Africa, it seemed like nobody knew where I came from. However, recently, there's been an increase in the knowledge of the culture. This is most likely due to the growth of the music industry and the "End SARS" movement of 2020, which were protests against police brutality in Nigeria. Additionally, artists like Burna Boy, Davido, and Wizkid have been putting out music that everybody over the world has been listening to. Along with the End SARS protests being shown on the news, people have begun to take an interest in the culture, which I can appreciate.

            <h2>Are Consignment Stores Considered Thrift Stores? - 06/20/23</h2>
            <p>
                As an avid thrifter, I frequent consignment stores. I've recently noticed that I go to consignment stores more often than thrift stores now. I wonder if consignment stores and thrift stores truly are the same. I thrift for a multitude of reasons. I can sell and buy used clothes, so I'm not buying new clothes all the time and other people's gently used clothes don't go to waste. I believe everyone needs to do their part to keep the earth greener. Additionally, thrifting is fun. You never know what you're going to find! However, I've realized that thrifting and consignment shopping is fundamentally different. Consignment shops are for profit, while thrift stores aren't. With this knowledge, I still feel good going to either, because you're still doing your part.

            <h2>Are Scrum Masters a Waste of Time? The Internet Thinks So. - 07/24/23</h2>
            <p>
                 I’ve been seeing some memes online about how scrum masters aren’t truly needed. While the memes are funny because a Scrum Master's work seems redundant, they truly are needed. Some say that Agile teams can function fine without Scrum Masters. They argue that team members can take more ownership of their roles/tasks. It seems like the responsibilities of a Scrum Master, like organizing meetings and removing obstacles, could be spread among team members. But it's important to remember that Scrum Masters bring a specialized expertise in many Agile practices and they provide valuable guidance, especially in complex projects or with teams who are new to Agile. One must weigh the benefits of a Scrum Master’s experience against the potential gains of a more decentralized team.
